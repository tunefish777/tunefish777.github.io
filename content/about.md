Hi, my name is Moritz Waser (but I go by some form of 'tunefish' on almost every platform).
I am currently a PhD-student in the System Security research group at the [Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK)](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at) at [TU Graz](https://www.tugraz.at) in Austria.
Before that, I was employed at [AVL List GmbH](https://www.avl.com) as a student trainee where I implement low level interfaces on microcontrollers for powertrain control applications.
My interests are fairly widespread.
When it comes to computer science I mostly enjoy working with hardware.
This includes both interacting with real hardware (as in building and measuring things) as well as anything related to hardware simulation, synthesis and verification.
In terms of research, I chose to focus on memory safety topics related to capability architectures, especially the CHERI ISA extension.
In my free time, I am a member of [machquadrat](https://machquadrat.org), a hacker-/makerspace in Styria/Austria and I am also an aspiring amateur musician.
I play euphonium in a wind orchestra and piano/bass in a blues-rock band.
If I find time for it I would also love to look into writing and conducting music in the future.

## About this server
I previously tried to host and maintain the webserver for this website myself, but it proved to be too much of a hassle to keep everything up-to-date.
As a result, I've migrated the website to github, where I can easily deploy changes through github actions.
The website, which is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), is designed to be very minimal and lightweight to be fast and responsive.
