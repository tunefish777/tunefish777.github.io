Hi, my name is Moritz Waser (but I go by some form of 'tunefish' on almost every platform).
I am currently a PhD-student in the System Security research group at the [Institute of Information Security (ISEC)](https://www.isec.tugraz.at) at [TU Graz](https://www.tugraz.at) in Austria, where I teach the Bachelor's course [Computer Organization and Networks](https://isec.tugraz.at/con) and the Master's course [Digital System Design](https://isec.tugraz.at/dsd).
Before that, I was employed at [AVL List GmbH](https://www.avl.com) as a student trainee where I implement low level interfaces on microcontrollers for powertrain control applications.
My interests are fairly widespread.
When it comes to computer science I mostly enjoy working with hardware.
This includes both interacting with real hardware (as in building and measuring things) as well as anything related to hardware simulation, synthesis and verification.
In terms of research, I chose to focus on memory safety topics related to capability architectures, especially the [CHERI ISA extension](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/).
I am a member of [machquadrat](https://machquadrat.org), a hacker-/makerspace in Styria/Austria.

My biggest passion besides technology is definitely music.
I've been playing euphonium since 2004, piano since 2012 and electric bass since 2021.
I'm a member of [Stadtkapelle Gleisdorf](https://www.stadtkapelle-gleisdorf.at), where I play euphonium, and [High Gain](https://www.instagram.com/highgain_music/), where I play synth and bass.
Besides live music, I have quite a few tools to create electronic music without a computer (DAWless setup).
Sometimes I record little jams and upload them my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@tunefish8041).

When I'm not working or playing music somewhere, I enjoy reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/tunefish) or [manga](https://myanimelist.net/mangalist/tunefish777), watching movies, series or [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/tunefish777), going to the gym and bouldering/rope climbing.

## About this server
I previously tried to host and maintain the webserver for this website myself, but it proved to be too much of a hassle to keep everything up-to-date.
As a result, I've migrated the website to github, where I can easily deploy changes through github actions.
The website, which is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), is designed to be very minimal and lightweight to be fast and responsive.
